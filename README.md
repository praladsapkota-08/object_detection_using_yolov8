# YOLOv8 Object Detection Project

This repository is the starting point for an object detection workflow using YOLOv8.  
The initial dataset is football player detection from Roboflow, and the project is structured to allow easy adaptation to custom datasets later.

## Project Structure
- data/ : datasets
- configs/ : YAML config files
- notebooks/ : Jupyter notebooks (CLI and API experiments)
